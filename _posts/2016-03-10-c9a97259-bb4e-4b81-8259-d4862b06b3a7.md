Thanks for visiting my site!  My name is Brad Willits and I want to give you free tennis lessons.  I am a Certified Tennis Pro with the USPTA and I have many years of teaching experience.  My mission is to introduce and teach as many people as possible to this wonderful game that I have loved to play since I was 10 years old.  If you live close to Pensacola and want free lessons, just shoot me an email at jbradwillits@yahoo.com or give me a call at 630 608-3394\.  If you are not in the area, I can help you online with any questions that you have. Thanks again for stopping by my site and I look forward to meeting you!
